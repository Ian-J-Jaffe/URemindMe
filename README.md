# uRemIndMe

Help students maintain healthy balanced productive schedule.

## What the To-Do App is going to do

    1. Stores class schedule and work schedule. Reminds you when class starts.
    2. You can enter assignments and difficulty/importance of the assignment.
    3. Based on the assignment difficulty and its due date, we will create a schedule that they are welcome to use.
    4. All of the schedule planning will be based on 8-8-8 rule.
    5. Have an Analytical page that shows how often and consistent the user are hitting there goals..

The 8-8-8 rule means 8 hours of sleeping, 8 hours of class and studying and 8 hours of personal time.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment started as a group project between me and one other student. About half way through the semester, all students had to join another group, turning this from as two person project to a four person project. There was an [old repository](https://github.com/IanJaffeVCU/Android_App) that we moved away from because every new version of the project was put into a new folder. We were doing version control on a service that does version control. I made a new repository using the latest version of the code and using [github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to know when a commit prevented the app from compiling.

This was the first semester that I used git and github. A skill that I should have learned sooner since I now use git for every program I worked on since.
